# Configure Teamspeak3 Icons

This will install the Teamspeak3 icons for fallback use in any theme lacking an icon for Teamspeak.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running.
```
git clone https://github.com/audirs4/teamspeak-setup.git
```
## Motivation

It was great that Teamspeak is available on Linux and runs well. It is annoying though that the application does not install itself properly in any sort of way, but just unpacks in a directory. I wanted to add an addition to install the icons to simplify a full setup.

## Execution

Run the script and it will move all the primary icon sizes used in Gnome/Unity.
```
./install_teamspeak3_icons.sh
```
